Some random notes as I hack.  Much or all of this may be nonsense.  Included in
the package only in case you care about how little I know.  ^_^

GRAPHICS
use native .rc8/.rct formats, but can also use .png files if no native file of the
given name is found.

TEXT OUTPUT

"＠name" uses "name" as a name, but only if the first character of 
the subsequent text is "「".  It appears that the "「" is then only displayed 
some of the time; for example, "「...」" displays as it is, but "「（...）" just 
displays the "（...）".  This needs investigation.

JUMPS
are relative to the end of the pointer.

  jmp ptr : unconditional
  jne (value) ptr : jump if something (top of stack?) != value
  switch { ptrs }: table jump based on something (top of stack?)

CALLS

  callXXX<function[, n]> (...)
  
    "function" is an entrypoint identifier as found in the entrypoint
    table in the MJO header.  Presumably they're some sort of hash of
    the function's actual name.  Goodness only knows what algorithm,
    though.  :(
    
    If the identifier is in the current .mjo, presumably that version is
    used, otherwise presumably other files are searched for it; the
    precise mechanism is unclear.  A couple of music-related functions
    are duplicated in most files.


OPCODES (see also disasm.ml)

  82b
    rtl? end?

  82c int32?
  830 int32?
  831 int32?
    ??
    pure guess, maybe arithmetic?

  83a int16
    int16 increments through the file: line references a la RealLive's 0x0a?

  841
    Always seems to follow a text display string: refresh? savepoint?
