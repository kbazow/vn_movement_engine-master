#BGIKit
A solution for translators about script files in Ethornell Buriko General Interpreter (BGI).

##About the tools
###ScriptDecoder
> Decode BGI script file to readable text file which can be used for translation.

###ScriptEncoder
> Encode text file into orginal script file, results as a new script file.
> 
> Note: You should place the org. file along with the text file. ScriptEncoder needs some information countains in the orginal script file.

###SwapNameAndSentence
> Swap the position of speaker's name and his/her sentence.
> 
> Only for some games which have old script format (eg. `FORTUNE ARTERIAL`, `Tayutama: Kiss on my Deity (タユタマ -Kiss on my Deity-)`).

###SysgrpConverter
> Convert file between `sysgrp` format and standard bmp format.
